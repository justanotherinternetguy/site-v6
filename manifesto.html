          <h1><span style="color:green;font-size: 3rem;">O</span>f the current state of the internet</h1>
          <p>The internet is <strong>not</strong> just a product anymore. The internet is turning <strong>us into the product.</strong> The past decade has seen large corprations turning us into profit machines. User data is sold and used as data to fuel advertisement campaigns and algorithms that pour and endless stream of biased content into our faces. The modern internet is filled with censorship, "political correctness", and <strong>corporate hell</strong> where websites are stripped of personality. <strong>Short-form</strong>, <strong>addictive</strong> algorithms and content are wasting the lives of teenagers and children in the most developed and advanced countries. Those that are aware of the privacy issues of social media are <strong>unable</strong> to distance themselves from social media because it would mean <strong>breaking away from normal social interaction with friends and family</strong>. Some governments <strong>use the internet as a means of control over their population</strong>, making their population dependent on it for daily life. Modern social media, filled with "likes" and "follower counts" encourage content creators to <strong>ignore the consequences of their actions</strong> and focus <strong>purely on audience engagement and attention</strong>.</p>
          <h1><span style="color:green;font-size:3rem;">O</span>f what the internet should be</h1>
          <p>The internet should be a place for <strong style="color: red">free self-expression</strong>, <strong style="color: orange">free access to information and software</strong>, <strong style="color: blue">free, uncensored, unmonitored communication with anyone</strong>, <strong style="color: green;">NO control by ANY corporation</strong>, <strong style="color: purple">and PURELY governed by the USERS.</strong></p>
          <h1><span style="color:green;font-size:3rem;">R</span>egarding modern, mainstream social media</h1>
          <h2>Short-form video content</h2>
          <p>I am particularly infuriated by the growth of TikTok and its content format because of how addictive it truly is. Every <i>relevant</i> social media app has recognized the power and potential of video "shorts", which TikTok pioneered. For those not familiar, "shorts" refer to a type of video entertainment where the videos are at most 1-2 minutes long. Usually, "shorts" are presented in an endless fashion - simply scroll down to view the next video, double tap to like, tap another button to follow, etc etc. TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and many more social media services are implementing "shorts" to improve user retention and advertisement viewership. <strong>And this works.</strong> Shorts are <strong>convenient and addictive</strong>, capturing the user with the promise of an infinite feed of relevant and interesting content.</p>
          <h3>Issue #1: Data Privacy</h3>
          <p>There is a reason why TikTok can stay completely free. <strong>It's recommendation algorithm</strong> is just so powerful that it can <strong>learn your interests, hobbies, and even political biases</strong> to give you the content <strong>that you would be most interested watching</strong>. This data is then <strong>given to advertisers</strong> to promote relevant ads/products as you watch the videos. This is why TikTok can stay <strong>completely free.</strong> The users <strong>are</strong> the source of income. There is <strong>no regard</strong> for the privacy of your data. <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/1448" target="_blank">[cite: tosdr, tiktok]</a> <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/311" target="_blank">[cite: tosdr, snapchat]</a> <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/274" target="_blank">[cite: tosdr, youtube]</a> <a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/219" target="_blank">[cite: tosdr, instagram]</a></p>
          <h3>Issue #2: Addictive content</h3>
          <p>I have more of a problem with the <i>form</i> of the content itself rather than the actual content. The issue is that the user knows <strong>there will always be good content</strong> as they continue scrolling. <a href="https://www.barroshouse.com/readings/TikTok%20Brain%20Explained_%20Why%20Some%20Kids%20Seem%20Hooked%20on%20Social%20Video%20Feeds%20-%20WSJ.pdf" target="_blank">[a good explanation on the science behind tiktok addiction]</a>. TikTok's algorithm just offers <strong>a substantial burst of pleasure/satisfaction</strong> every time a video is watched. This boost of pleasure keeps the user wanting to watch more and more, leading to (perhaps) hours of productive time wasted. It also leaves the user wanting to watch more, making the user more and more dependent on this type of instant-gratification content.</p>
          <h2>Censorship, political correctness, and cancel culture</h2>
        <p><strong>No</strong> social media service should censor <strong>anything.</strong> People should be allowed to <strong>express themselves</strong> on social media. Keep in the mind that the very fundamental goal of social media is <strong>ease of communication</strong>, not ease of "politically correct" communication. Social media should be a reflection of our real-life communication, not a way for governments or corporations to control what we say. A true social media service does one thing only: <strong>to allow for efficient communication between multiple parties</strong>. That's it.</p>
        <p>Even if someone spreads disinformation that may harm others, <strong>no one should be using social media as a credible/reliable source of information</strong>. This may sound harsh, but those that use Twitter as a source of news <strong>without checking other reputable independent source(s) of information</strong> probably deserve to be harmed by whatever misinformation they come across. Social media is a place for <strong>opinions</strong>, which are/should not be backed by <strong>any evidence</strong>. It completely valid to post COVID-19 conspiracies without being censored or shadowbanned. With the increasing amount of AI-generated "deepfakes" and the rapid propagation of content throughout the internet, it is always important to <strong>cross-reference and fact-check</strong> anything you come across.</p>
